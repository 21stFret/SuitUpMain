1,1,Technical Manual Extracts,Shockwave Pulse,"The Mark-VII Suit is equipped with a Shockwave Pulse Generator which is capable of creating a 10-meter radius energy wave, very effective at repelling Crawler swarms at close distance. WARNING: Cells require time to charge up between each blast."
2,1,Technical Manual Extracts,Combat Drone,"Each Mark-VII Suit is connected to the D.R.O.N.E network, giving the pilot access to a range of advanced weaponry, air support and tactical supplies. NOTE: The network can only issue 5 unique D.R.O.N.E abilities per pilot to maintain stable connection throughout all Suits."
3,1,Technical Manual Extracts,Energy Management,Mark-VII suits utilize XR-7 energy cells to power all Tech weapons. Combat systems will rapidly drain cells but the temporal transformer recharges whilst not in use. Weapons will not be able to function without enough power in the cell. NOTE: Energy cells can be overcharged although it is not recommended.
4,1,Technical Manual Extracts,Assault Weaponry,The Mark-VII's arm-mounted M240 Rotary Cannon delivers sustained high-velocity projectile fire. Effective against Crawler carapaces at ranges up to 50 meters. NOTE: All ammunition is synthesized from quantum entangled tungsten. Rounds return to their clip after being fired creating an infinite ammo loop.
5,2,Technical Manual Extracts,Emergency Protocol,"WARNING: Mark-VII Chrono-suits are equipped with emergency dimensional shift protocols. In case of critical suit damage or pilot death, automatic teleportation will initiate. Pilots' memories will be wiped to lengthen mental capacity over many temporal shifts and deaths. Return coordinates are preset. Do not attempt to override."
6,1,OmniCorp Logs,Recruitment Log #276,"Congratulations on being selected for the OmniCorp Expeditionary Mech Program! Your psychological profile and combat simulations show exceptional promise. Remember, with each successful planetary cleanse, you'll be rewarded with both substantial financial compensation and the gratitude of humanity. The Crawler threat must be contained! Glory and Honor!"
7,2,OmniCorp Logs,Mission Brief #147-A,"Primary Objective: Locate and neutralize targets. Crawlers have infested the area and a particularly large and aggressive one at point Alpha. Secondary Objective: Retrieve research material, code name [CLASSIFIED]."
8,2,OmniCorp Logs,Research Division Memo,"The temporal shards are exceeding expectations. Each dimension they're found in appears to be a slight variation of the original timeline. Subject 23 has successfully collected two shards. Unfortunately, the subject's mental state has deteriorated significantly. Recommend immediate termination and transfer of shards to secure storage. Ensure that the Mark-VII deals with this issue."
9,3,OmniCorp Logs,Field Commander's Report #93-B,"Subject 24's field performance with the Mark-VII mech exceeds all previous metrics. After the unfortunate incident with Subject 23, we've implemented additional psyche stabilizers in the neural interface.CRITICAL UPDATE: Subject 24 reported ""singing crystals"". Protocol C-TALK has been initiated and audio recordings are being analyzed by Research Division. The Board must be informed if we find evidence of information leakage. Glory and Honor!"
9,3,OmniCorp Logs,Field Commander's Report  #94-A,"WARNING: Temporal Echo detected in Sector 17. Subject 24 reported visual contact with ""another version"" of themselves. Protocol DOPPELGANGER was initiated immediately with successful memory purge. The Mark-VII's cognitive monitoring systems show no lingering awareness of the encounter. URGENT: Two temporal shards have been secured in close proximity. Subject 24 is showing early signs of temporal awareness hallucinations. If symptoms persist, prepare for Protocol SUNDOWN implementation before the exponential effects compromise mission integrity. Glory and Honor!"
10,2,Field Logs,- Unknown -,…. crystal formations... they vibrate….. No….. sing….…crawlers are drawn to them…. like moths to a … ..suits sensors…..haywire…..close… rendezvous… six hours ago…. No sign …
11,1,Field Logs,Lt. Sarah Chen,"Third deployment. Something's wrong. I keep seeing the same places, but... different. Like looking at a photograph from slightly different angles. But today what the .....! I found another pilot's helmet. The ID tag said S.Chen. Did I…. die here?"
12,3,Field Logs,- Unknown -,"I see it so clearly now. The recruitment, the promises, the glory - it's all lies. We're not here to protect the planet. We're trapped in their loop, gathering these shards. But I've found three now. I can feel them resonating together. One more. Just one more and I can break free. The Crawlers... they're not hunting us. They're trying to help us understand!"
13,2,Field Logs,Cpt. Arthur Scott,Day 14 - I think. Chronometer's fried. Three squads gone. Command keeps sending reinforcements but they never arrive. Found giant crystal formation in sector 7. Much larger than any we've documented. The Crawlers... they're not attacking it. They're... worshipping it?
14,4,Field Logs,- Unknown -,"To whoever finds this: There are four shards. Four dimensions. The suit won't let you die - it'll just send you to another variation of this hell. But collect all four shards, and you can break the cycle. The Crawlers covert them because they're the key. OmniCorp doesn't want to save humanity. They want to harvest the shards' power, and we're their lab rats. To the next pilot who reads this: You're not alone. We've all been here before, in different times, different dimensions. Find the shards. Break free. And whatever you do, don't trust the voice in the suit."
15,,REDACTED,TA,"When multiple shards are in close proximity their effects are exponential. This can cause tears or ripples in time which have been seen to cause hallucinations in some test subjects. These can be maintained if the subject undergoes chemical memory suppression. The onboard AI of the Mark-VII Suit will track and monitor brain function and should the pilot show signs of temporal awareness (TA), initiate Protocol SUNDOWN immediately."
16,,REDACTED,SUNDOWN,"To ensure total confidentiality, the SUNDOWN Protocol has been put in place. This will humanly reduce the pilots' cognitive functions by electric stimuli via the Mark-VII neural-interface. Once docile, the Mark-VII Suit will autopilot back to HQ where the pilot will be repurposed for future missions. CAUTION: Complete neural patterns must be preserved for successful repurposing."
17,,REDACTED,C-TALK ,"Mark-VII sensors have detected organized communication patterns between Crawler hives and crystalline formations. All audio recordings of these patterns must be isolated and transmitted to the Research Division immediately. NOTE: Pilots reporting ""singing"" or ""voices"" from crystals should be scheduled for immediate extraction and memory recalibration."
18,,REDACTED,TE,"Recent tests confirm that pilots' neural patterns leave ""temporal echoes"" or TE, in dimensional space after multiple shifts. These echoes can manifest as hallucinations of alternate selves. CRITICAL: If pilot reports encountering ""themselves,"" administer immediate memory purge and initiate PROTOCOL DOPPELGANGER. Under NO circumstances should pilots be allowed to physically interact with temporal echoes of themselves."
